        <b> Maharashtra Traditional Dresses</b><br>
        The people of Maharashtra have their traditions that are a reflection of their heritage and a result of the climatic, social, and economic conditions that have prevailed in their land in the long run. The same can be said about the traditional dresses of Maharashtra.
        Maharashtrian clothing not only pleases the aesthetic sense but also, more importantly, portrays the rich heritage of the state, be it in terms of caste, profession, or geographic factors.
        The people of a region adopt a particular style of drapery or clothing as well as ornaments which are passed on from generation to generation, retaining its individuality as well as changing in some aspect or another. Such changes and development in traditional clothing are brought about by geographic, social, political as well as foreign influence. Although traditional clothing distinguishes one ethnicity from another, it also emphasizes the unifying solidarity that exists among the people of a particular culture.

Men usually wear a Kurta or Kediyu, while women dress in sarees or Chaniya Choli, though recently Salwar Kameez is also preferred by Gujarat women.
        <br><br>
        <b>Panjabi Traditional Dresses</b> <br>
        Punjab contains one of the oldest and the richest cultures in the world which is exhibited in every possible way. It is enveloped with bright colours and high-spirited people that can be best expressed through their traditional garbs.

        <b>Bengali Traditional Dresses</b><br>
        The state of West Bengal is synonymous with a rich cultural heritage that reflects in its literature, cuisine, music, painting and much more. Bengal's sartorial legacy derives from the royal patronage and the nobility that valued the richness of traditional techniques of weaving, embroidery and stitching.
        No image of Bengali women is complete without the six-yards of elegance that defines Bengali saree. A host of traditional techniques practised on pure cotton and silk, authentic motifs and drapes of the Bengali saris spell unique charm, sensuousness and allure at the same time.
        The traditional attire for men in Bengal is a 'Panjabi', which is the equivalent of north-Indian kurta, paired with a dhoti- a plain loincloth in cotton or silk. Panjabis can be either short or long ending up to knees. What distinguishes Panjabis from the usual kurta is the authentic Bengali fabric that can range from tussar silk, cotton-silk or muga-silk embroidered with kantha around neckline or buttonholes.

        <b>SouthIndian Traditional Dresses</b><br>
        South Indian culture is exemplified through its dance, traditional clothing and cuisine. Although there are minor variations in the costumes and the ways of wearing it, the traditional dresses of South India do not vary too much. 
        The traditional dress of South Indian women is mainly saree and for the men, it is either a white dhoti or a colourful lungi with typical batik patterns.

The lungi is draped over clockwise or counter clockwise and is tied at the back or fixed just along the waistline. 
        It is sometimes lifted to the knee and tied at the waist or is just held in hand to speed walk.
