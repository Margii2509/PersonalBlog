        <b>Maharashtrian</b> or Marathi cuisine is the cuisine of the Marathi people from the Indian state of Maharashtra. It has distinctive attributes, while sharing much with other Indian cuisines. Traditionally, Maharashtrians have considered their food to be more austere than others.
        Maharashtrian cuisine includes mild and spicy dishes. Wheat, rice, jowar, bajri, vegetables, lentils and fruit are dietary staples. Peanuts and cashews are often served with vegetables. 
        Meat was traditionally used sparsely or only by the well off until recently, because of economic conditions and culture.<br><br>
        <b>Gujarati</b> cuisine is the cuisine of the Indian state of Gujarat. The typical Gujarati thali consists of rotli, dal or curry, rice, and shaak (a dish made up of several different combinations of vegetables and spices, which may be either spicy or sweet). 
        The thali will also include preparations made from pulses or whole beans (called kathor in Gujarati) such as moong, black eyed beans etc., a snack item (farsaan) like dhokla, pathra, samosa, fafda, etc. and a sweet (mishthaan) like mohanthal, jalebi, sevaiya etc.
        Gujarati cuisine varies widely in flavour and heat, depending on a family's tastes as well as the region of Gujarat to which they belong. North Gujarat, Kathiawad, Kachchh, Central Gujarat and South Gujarat are the five major regions of Gujarat that contribute their unique touch to Gujarati cuisine. 
        Many Gujarati dishes are distinctively sweet, salty, and spicy commonly.<br><br>
        <b>Rajasthani</b> cuisine is the cuisine of the Rajasthan state in North West India. 
        It was influenced by various factors like the warlike lifestyles of its inhabitants, the availability of ingredients in an arid region and by Hindu temple traditions of sampradayas like Pushtimarg and Ramanandi. 
        Food that could last for several days and could be eaten without heating was preferred. Scarcity of water and fresh green vegetables have all had their effect on the cooking. Signature Rajasthani dishes include Dal Baati Churma, Panchratna Dal, Papad ro Saag, Ker Sangri, Gatte ro Saag. It is also known for its snacks like Bikaneri bhujia, Mirchi bada and Kanda kachauri. 
        Other famous dishes include Dal Baati, malaidar special lassi (lassi) and Lashun ki chutney (hot garlic paste), Mawa lassi from Jodhpur, Alwar ka mawa, Malpauas from Pushkar and rasgulla from Bikaner, "paniya"and "gheriya" from Mewar.<br><br>
        <b>Madhya Pradesh</b> cuisine also borrows heavily from its Neighbours. With the Malwa region around the western part of the state, Bundelkhand, and Mewar in the north, the food in Madhya Pradesh has flavours of Rajasthani food (especially the Dal Bafla) and Gujarat (with the Kadhi-Fafda). Madhya Pradesh is truly a gastronomic adventure for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike! 
        No visit to Madhya Pradesh is complete without a tasting of the wide varieties of food it has to offer.
        From daily dishes to quick street food, desserts, and puddings to even homemade liquor – each region of Madhya Pradesh is known for its different taste palettes. In the drier areas of north and western parts of Madhya Pradesh, wheat, and meat play an important role, while the south of the state is wetter and is dominated by fish and rice.<br><br>
        <b>Goan</b> cuisine consists of regional foods popular in Goa, an Indian state located along India's west coast on the shore of the Arabian Sea. Rice, seafood, coconut, vegetables, meat, bread, pork and local spices are some of the main ingredients in Goan cuisine. 
        Use of kokum and vinegar is another distinct feature. Goan food is considered incomplete without fish.
        The cuisine of Goan people is mostly seafood-based; the staple foods are rice and fish. Kingfish (Visvonn विस्वण or Isvonn इस्वण) is one of the most commonly eaten varieties of fish. Other fish varieties include pomfret, shark, tuna, sardines, and mackerel. Among the shellfish are crabs, prawns, tiger prawns, lobster, squid, and mussels. 
        The cuisine of Goan Catholics is heavily influenced by Portuguese cuisine.<br><br>
