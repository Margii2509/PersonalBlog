        <b>Jharkhandi cuisine</b> is the cuisine of the Indian state of Jharkhand. 
            Staple foods are rice, dal and vegetables. Common meals often consist of vegetables that are cooked in various ways, such as curried, fried, roasted and boiled. 
            Many traditional dishes of Jharkhand may not be available at restaurants.Jharkhand is a state that people don’t generally relate to mouth-watering delicacies, but like all the other states it too has some staple and a delicious treasure trove of recipes. The cuisine of Jharkhand is not very different from its neighbouring Bihar. It is truly exquisite and consists of a different cooking style which makes it completely unique. 
            They use mustard oil as a medium in cooking which gives it the characteristic aroma.<br><br>

            <b>Bengali Cuisine</b> that originated and evolved in the region of Bengal situated in the eastern subcontinent of India (presently divided into West Bengal in India and a separate nation called Bangladesh) is rich and varied in its platter starting from snacks to main courses to sweets. Although the food habits, tastes, 
            preferences and choice of items vary with different districts, communities and religions, the basic course generally remains the same with rice and fish playing a dominant role. Probably this is why a Bengali is often typified as a ‘Maache-Bhaate-Bangali’ where Maach means fish and Bhaat means boiled rice in Bengali. A Bengali meal follows a multi-course tradition where food is served course-wise usually in a specific format, marking it as the only meal of the subcontinent to have evolved such convention. 
            It is quite similar to the present day service à la russe style of French cuisine. Generally a Bengali meal starts with a ‘Shukto’ (a bitter preparation) followed by ‘Shak’ (leafy vegetables), Dal (pulses), variety of vegetables, fish/mutton/chicken/egg curry, chutney (sweet-sour saucy item) and ends with sweet dish like curd and other traditional sweets like sandesh or rosogolla. 
            With time Bengalis have embraced different culinary influences as well including that of the Mughlas, Chinese and British subtly twisting these to suit their own taste-buds.<br><br>

        <b>The cuisine of Odisha</b>, popularly known as the Odia Cuisine, is a melange of varied items and practices. 
            As Odisha is bordered by both North Indian and South Indian states, food of Odisha is majorly influenced by the food of North India, Bengal and Assam. Rice is the staple food of Odisha with mustard oil used as a cooking medium in many households. Yoghurt forms a major part of many dishes of Odisha while many sweets are based on chhena (a form of cheese). 
            Odia cuisine is less oily and spice but a burst of flavours. Aptly called 'the Goa of Eastern India'.Odisha reflects the heritage, culture, and traditions through its tourist destinations, religious and cultural centres, people, customs, rituals and last but not the least food. 
            Traditional recipes of mouth-watering Odisha food not only allure the locals but attracts the tourists, especially culinary enthusiasts, and food lovers.<br><br>
            
            <b> Chattisgarh Cuisine </b>Being a state which produces staple food in abundance, a great part of the food culture of Chhattisgarh consists of the staple crops such as Rice, 
            Bajra, Jawar. The food of the state is highly inspired from its neighbouring states. Hence, a great meal of food of Chhattisgarh promises a great taste and delicious inspirations from its neighbours.
            Here are famous dishes of Chhattisgarh that you must munch on to experience the diversity of the food culture of India.

        <b>Arunachal Pradesh Cuisine</b> is one of the states of northeastern India and just like all the other North-Eastern states, its tradition and culture are one of the main focus of Indian tourism. Food forms an essential part of the culture of North East India, and is a traveller's urge to understand the unknown, the food of Arunachal Pradesh is a topic that draws a lot of attention! 
            The first thing you should know about Arunachal Pradesh food is that it differs from tribe to tribe.
            As you move toward the eastern side of Arunachal people are dependent on bamboo and other leafy vegetables which are strictly boiled. Fried food is not very popular as people like to eat either boiled or smoked food. As you move toward the town of Tawang and places closer to the country of Tibet you'll notice that dairy products are more in use. 
            The people closest to the city are more dependent on a normal day to day products.<br><br>
