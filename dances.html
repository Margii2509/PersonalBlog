        <b>Bharatnatyam</b><br>
        Bharatnatyam is one of the most popular classical Indian dances. Bharatnatyam is more popular in South Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.
        Bharatnatyam dance is almost 2,000 years old. It is believed that Bharatnatyam was revealed by Lord Brahma to Bharata, a famous sage who then codified this sacred dance in a Sanskrit text called the Natya Shastra. 
        The Natya Shastra is one of the fundamental treatises on Indian drama and aesthetics.<br><br>
        <b>Kathak</b><br>
        Kathak is one of the most important classical dances of India. Kathak is said to be derived from the word katha, meaning "the art of storytelling." 
        The Kathak dance form originated in north India and was very similar to the Bharatnatyam dance form. 
        In ancient India, there were Kathakars or bards who used to recite religious and mythological tales to the accompaniment music, mime and dance. <br><br>
        <b>Kathakali</b><br>

        <b>Kuchipudi</b><br>    
        Kuchipudi is one of the classical dance forms of the South India. Kuchipudi derives its name from the Kuchipudi village of Andhra Pradesh. 
        In the seventeenth century the Kuchipudi village was presented to the Brahmins, who were experts in staging dance and drama. 
        Kuchipudi exhibits scenes from the Hindu Epics, legends and mythological tales through a combination of music, dance and acting. 
        Like other classical dances, Kuchipudi also comprises pure dance, mime and histrionics but it is the use of speech that distinguishes Kuchipudi's presentation as dance drama.<br><br>
        <b>Manipuri</b><br>
        Manipuri is one of the six major classical dances of India. Manipuri dance is indigenous to Manipur, the North eastern state of India. 
        The Manipuri dance style is inextricably woven into the life pattern of Manipuri people. 
        The most striking part of Manipur dance is its colorful decoration, lightness of dancing foot, delicacy of abhinaya (drama), lilting music and poetic charm. 
        The Manipuri dance form is mostly ritualistic and draws heavily from the rich culture of the state of Manipur.<br><br>
        <b>Odissi</b><br>
        Odissi is one of the famous classical Indian dances from Orissa state. 
        The history of Odissi dance is almost two thousand years old. Odissi is a highly inspired, passionate, ecstatic and sensuous form of dance. 
        Like most of the South Indian classical dances of India Odissi too had its origin in the Devadasi tradition. The state of Orissa has a great cultural history.<br><br>
        <b>Mohiniattam</b><br>

        Thus, Mohiniattam dance form is a beautiful feminine style with surging flow of body movements. 
        Mohiniattam dance in Kerala developed in the tradition of Devadasi system, which later grew and developed a classical status.<br><br>
        <b>Sattariya</b><br>
        Sattriya dances are devotional in nature as they were intended for propagation of neo-Vaishnavism. 
        Its highlights are intense emotional fervour, and in its solo avatar now dramatic abhinaya is prominent in contrast to nritta, pure dance.
        Sattriya dance tradition is governed by strictly laid down principles in respect of hastamudras, footworks, aharyas, music etc.,
        Sattriya dance is usually based primarily on the stories of Krishna-Radha relations, or sometimes on the stories of Ram-Sita.
        Sattriya Nrityais a genre of dance drama that tells mythical and religious stories through hand and face expressions. 
        The basic dance unit and exercise of a Sattriya is called a Mati Akhara, equal 64 just like in Natya Shastra, are the foundational sets dancers learn during their training.<br><br>
