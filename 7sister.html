        <b> Assam Cuisine </b>has to offer an intriguing array of culinary jewels. It’s all about getting that right depth of flavours and complexity with a minimum amount of ingredients and cooking. 
        In the end, a good dash of best quality mustard oil perfectly binds the dish with its distinctive flavour and aroma.Masor Tenga is a hearty, humble, 
        Assamese fish curry that is a regular feature during lunch and dinner in any Assamese household. it that distinguishing tangy taste and use of typical Assamese herbs and spices add to the overall spiciness of this dish. 
        It starts by marinating fish pieces in a generous mix of turmeric, red chilli powder, and salt, and deep-frying them in mustard oil.<br><br>

       <b>Nagaland Cuisine</b> Simple, fulfilling, and fresh are the three words that embody Naga cuisine, but what is it that makes it so individualistic yet varied? Not many people know about traditional Naga cuisine, and there’s a reason why—it’s almost impossible to imagine Indian cuisine without aromatic masalas, excessive use of oil, or pantry staples such as onion, garlic, and chillies. And Naga cuisine is just that (or not)! Put simply, Naga cuisine is a beautiful conglomeration of multiple traditional recipes of its innumerable tribes. 
        Coming from a place where it is almost impossible to grow a huge variety of vegetables, dried and preserved meat plays a significant role in their everyday lives.<br><br>
        <b> Meghalaya Cuisine</b> A profoundly comforting bowl of mildly spiced aromatic rice enhanced by the smokiness from the pork and sweetness from caramelised onions, this Khasi favourite is traditionally served on a cold winter’s evening or a rainy afternoon, when it warms from within. There are few things more comforting than a bowl of well-made Jadoh served with a boiled egg on top, especially at the end of a wet day in the hills, 
            which isn’t a rarity in this part of the country considering it is one of the wettest regions on earth. Jadoh is arguably Shillong’s favourite food, and once you taste it.<br><br>

        <b>Tripura cuisine</b> is most known for its recipes without oil, and Chikhvi is one of them. 
            It is a representative dish of the state made of bamboo shoots and pork. The magic begins by adding peeled and chopped bamboo shoots, chunks of pork, jackfruit, green papaya in a pot of boiling water with baking soda along with generous portions of ginger paste, turmeric paste, rice flour paste, and chopped lime leaves, and green chillies. The ingredients are then simmered on low flame for about an hour to obtain the ideal balance between smokiness and lusciousness. 
            The result is tender pork and pickled bamboo shoots that are the hallmark of Tripura cuisine.<br><br>

            <b>Manipur Cuisine</b> Most Indian dishes don't quite hold a virtuous reputation when it comes to eating local, organic, and artisanal ingredients. Manipuri households, however, are a big exception with backyard ponds breeding their own fish, and gardens growing the freshest vegetables and herbs. 
            Everything here is pretty much organic, and freshness is a routine.
            Even if you aren’t much of a salad person, a bowl of Singju, which is essentially a salad made of freshly foraged vegetables such as raw papaya, cabbage, banana flower, 
            and lotus stem, will definitely change you and your food preferences.<br><br>
            
            <b> Mizoram Cuisine</b> Amongst all the states boasting of their flavourful regional cuisines, one of the seven sisters—Mizoram—also has a variety of unimaginably delicious delicacies to offer. Traditionally, Mizoram cuisine is pleasantly mild on our palates and considerably tinted with influences from Chinese and North Indian cuisines. 
                What makes it stand out is the irresistible fragrance and presentation of tempting delicacies laid out on banana leaves.<br><br>
            
            <b>Sikkim Cuisine</b> The food of Sikkim is a rich mixture of Nepalese, Tibetan and native Sikkimese food. Maize is one of the staple produce consumed in Sikkim. Influenced a lot by Nepal and Tibet, Sikkim cuisine is flavourful and delicious, maybe a bit too spicy for a non-asian. 
            The cuisine of Sikkim is primarily non-vegetarian but sikkim food also has fermented vegetables, which enables them to be preserved for a longer time.<br><br>
